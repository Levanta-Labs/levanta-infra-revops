//    the mapping enriches from. Keyed on the profile URL only; an email-only lead gets neither.
// 4. recordInterestedLead (lib/interested.ts) - the sequence every provider shares. HeyReach contributes the
//    person lookup (profile URL first, then address) and the thread note. It declines the event outright if
//    this Person already carries a HeyReach note from inside the duplicate window - which is what stops one
//    webhook registered against ALL campaigns leaving a note per campaign the lead is enrolled in.

//check in recordInterestedLead declines an event whose note is already on the Person from inside
//INTERESTED_DUPLICATE_WINDOW_MS - but a retry landing after that window, or one arriving while the note
//listing cannot be read, is still recorded a second time. The check narrows this; it does not remove it.

//stopped, because StopLeadInCampaign is driven by leadUrl - now reports itself as a skipped channel.
