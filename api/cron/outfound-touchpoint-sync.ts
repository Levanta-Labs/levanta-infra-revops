//FLOW: 1. per thread, fetch its messages. 2. keep only real sent/received traffic. 3. pair each with its cursor
//event. 4. sort the lot by time.
//[PERF] ONE REQUEST PER THREAD. The inbox listing carries no message bodies, so this is the second half of
//every read and the dominant cost of the sync. A thread is listed when ANY of its emails falls in the window
//and then yields its WHOLE history, so most of what comes back is older than the mark; the per-email cursor
//check in the handler is what discards it, exactly as on the HeyReach sync.
//[STABILITY] THE EXPANSION IS BUDGETED, which no other sync needs. Everywhere else the provider fetch is a
//bounded number of pages and the budget only has to guard the write loop. Here the fetch is one request PER
//THREAD, so a wide window - a first run, or a backfilled cursor - can spend the whole of maxDuration in this
//function alone. Vercel would then kill the run before saveSyncCursor, the next run would redo the same window,
//and the sync would never make progress: exactly the permanent loop lib/run-budget.ts exists to prevent.
//Stopping here is safe because the cursor has not moved - but ONLY if the caller then refuses to park it. See
//OutfoundExpansion.truncated.
//[STABILITY] A thread whose messages cannot be read is logged and passed over rather than failing the run. One
//unreadable thread must not cost the whole window, and the cursor never advanced past it, so it is retried next
//run - unlike a failed EMAIL, which is passed over permanently once its writes may have landed.

//[PERF] The expansion at step 4 spends one request per thread and happens BEFORE the budget loop opens, so a
//very wide window can spend real time there before the first email is ever written. The budget is measured from

//[STABILITY] The park at step 7 subtracts OUTFOUND_CURSOR_GRACE_MS, not the shared CURSOR_GRACE_MS. Outfound's

//KNOWN GAP: Outfound exposes no per-message auto-reply flag, so an out-of-office is counted as a touchpoint
//where the Instantly sync would discard it. Outfound does categorise replies as human or automatic, but only
//per THREAD, and applying a thread's verdict to every message in it would discard real replies alongside the
//bots. Closing this needs a per-message signal that the API does not currently carry.
