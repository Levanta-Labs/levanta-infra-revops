//(lib/heyreach.ts). 4. heyReachTouchpointEvents flattens them to a chronological message stream. 5. per
//message, skip anything at or below the mark, else processHeyReachTouchpoint. 6. advance the mark.
//6a. stop at the run budget if still going, or if a message was throttled before writing anything. 7. park at
//(now - CURSOR_GRACE_MS) and persist - the park is SKIPPED on either stop, since the messages the loop never
//reached must stay above the mark.

//touched since UTC midnight, each with its full message list, and hashes every message before the cursor
//rejects it. Cost grows through the day. Skipping conversations with no activity past the mark would avoid
//most of it; deliberately not done, so the per-message check in step 5 absorbs the whole load.
//[STABILITY] A failed message is counted and passed over, never retried - its earlier writes are committed.
//THE EXCEPTION is a transient failure before the first write, which is safe to attempt again precisely because
//nothing is committed yet; that stops the run instead - see ThrottledBeforeWrite (lib/attio.ts).
