// 2. parseInstantlyInterestedWebhook - require event_type and lead_email.
// 3. Ignore anything that is not lead_interested; Instantly sends opens and replies to the same URL.
// 4. Read the lead record back for the fields the webhook does not carry. Best-effort - see enrichFromInstantly.
// 5. recordInterestedLead (lib/interested.ts) - the sequence every provider shares. Instantly contributes the
//    person lookup (by address) and the thread note.
//
//[SECURITY] Step 1 precedes the body read, so an unauthenticated caller never reaches the parser.

//committed and returns 500; Instantly's retry would then repeat them, adding duplicate notes.
