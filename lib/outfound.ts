//Outfound is not a sequencer. It sits on top of one - it ingests from Smartlead, Instantly, EmailBison,
//HeyReach and AgentMail and warehouses every send, reply, bounce and category update. So the emails this module
//reads were sent by some other platform; Outfound is the place they can all be read from at once.
//
//Two consequences shape everything below:
//  - THE WAREHOUSE LAGS. Outfound refreshes on roughly a three-minute cadence, so an email that has happened is
//    not necessarily an email that can be read back yet. See OUTFOUND_CURSOR_GRACE_MS (lib/cursors.ts).
//  - THE INBOX IS THREADED. There is no endpoint listing individual emails in a time window: threads are listed,
//    and each thread's messages are fetched separately. fetchOutfoundThreadEmails is the second half of every
//    read, and the reason the touchpoint sync costs one request per thread rather than one per page.
//
//The API is private and has no public documentation. It is written against the spec the deployment serves
//itself, at https://api.outfound.io/openapi-client.json.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Raised on a 429, so a caller can tell "slow down" apart from "this request was wrong".
//WHY IT MATTERS HERE more than on the other providers: the touchpoint sync spends one request PER THREAD, and
//the client key is rate-limited per key, not per organization. The dashboard shows the ORGANIZATION ceiling
//(100K/hr on enterprise); `GET /rate-limit` reports what the key itself gets, which is a different and much
//smaller number - the key in use is on the `standard` tier at 9/second and 3,000/hour. Across twelve runs an
//hour that is roughly 250 threads per run before throttling, which a backlog reaches easily.

//an HTTP 500 and `{"detail":"An unexpected error occurred while listing email threads."}` - both the `Z` that
//Date#toISOString appends and an explicit `+00:00` offset do it, on either bound, with or without the other.
//A naive datetime is accepted. That is the signature of a timezone-aware value being compared against a naive
//database column, so the column is UTC and this sends UTC; only the designator is dropped.
//
//Verified by hand against the live API:
//    2026-09-02T13:58:30Z       -> 500        2026-09-02T13:58:30        -> 200

//Remove this ONLY once Outfound accepts an offset, and re-check both bounds when doing so. Sending a bare local

//[STABILITY] No platform filter is applied. Outfound carries every sequencer the workspace has connected, and
//narrowing to a named one here would silently drop a platform added later. If this sync ever needs to exclude
//a platform the CRM already reads directly, that is a `platform` query parameter on this call.
//[STABILITY] The bound is on the email timestamp, which is what the cursor keys on too, so window and cursor
//agree. Which of sent_at/created_at the filter reads is not documented; the grace margin absorbs the
//difference either way, because it is wider than the gap between them can plausibly be.
