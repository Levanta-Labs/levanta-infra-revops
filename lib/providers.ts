//=============================================================================================================
//The register of third-party platforms. Adding a fourth is meant to be an APPEND here plus its own extractor,
//and nothing else - no edit to the shared interested workflow, the Attio mapping, or the write path.
//
//Two registers, because a platform sits on two independent axes and a given one may be on either, both, or
//only one:
//
//  SOURCES      - platforms that can report a lead as interested. Aircall, Instantly, HeyReach and Outfound
//                 all do.
//  SUPPRESSION  - outbound platforms that must stop contacting a lead once any source reports interest.
//                 Instantly, HeyReach and Outfound are here; Aircall is NOT, because it is a phone system with
//                 no campaign or blocklist API and nothing to call.
//
//A new platform is added to whichever registers apply. Everything downstream is derived.
//=============================================================================================================

//#region sources
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Every platform that can report interest. `displayName` is the only thing a new entry has to decide, and it is
//load-bearing: the source strings written into Attio and the note titles are derived from it, so it must be
//spelled exactly as the business wants to read it in a report. Changing one afterwards changes what new
//records say without changing what old ones already say.
//
//The provider KEY is used for two other things, both by derivation and neither needing an edit here:
//  - the counter-slug environment variables, ATTIO_PERSON_<KEY>_COUNTER_SLUG and ATTIO_COMPANY_<KEY>_COUNTER_SLUG
//    (see counterSlug in attio.ts), which a new provider must have added to the deployment before it can run;
//  - the Supabase cursor key its sync uses, if it polls.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//[LOGIC] The register itself. Appending one line here is what adds a provider.
const SOURCES = {

  instantly: { displayName: "Instantly" },

  //Outfound is a warehouse over other sequencers rather than a sender of its own, so the emails it reports were
  //sent elsewhere. It is a source in its own right here because the mail it carries is mail no other configured
  //provider reads - see lib/outfound.ts.
  outfound: { displayName: "Outfound" },
} as const;

//=============================================================================================================
//Attribution: which discrete source each provider represents, on the Person and on the Deal.
//
//THE TWO OBJECTS HAVE DIFFERENT OPTION IDS FOR THE SAME WORDS. "Cold Email" on a Person is
//4dca8bb3-... and on a Deal it is 6cae752e-...; they are separate select attributes that merely happen to be
//spelled alike. Writing a Deal's ID to a Person is not an error Attio reports as a mismatch - it rejects the
//option as unknown, updateAttioAttributes logs it and carries on, and the record ends up with no attribution
//while the run still reports success.
//
//So the mapping is split in two. A provider maps to a CATEGORY, which is a word; each object then has its own
//table turning that word into that object's ID. The provider table cannot name an ID at all, which is what
//makes a cross-object mix-up impossible to write rather than merely discouraged.
//
//WHY OPTION IDS AND NOT TITLES. Attio accepts either for a select - `[{ option: "Cold Email" }]` works just as
//well as `[{ option: "6cae752e-..." }]`. The ID is used because it survives a rename: someone relabelling
//"Cold Email" in the Attio UI keeps the same option_id, where a title write would start failing silently from
//that moment on with nothing in the code to say why.
//The trade is that these are unreadable, so each carries its title in a comment and a live smoke test asserts
//every one of them still exists on its own object's attribute - see tests/live/read-only.test.ts.
//
//SUB-SOURCE IS ABOUT WHOSE PLATFORM SENT IT, not which tool. Instantly, HeyReach and Aircall are Levanta's own;
//Outfound is the SAS platform.
