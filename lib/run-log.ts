//=============================================================================================================
//A transcript of one interested run, written back to every record it touched.
//
//WHY THIS EXISTS. Everything these workflows decide is already logged, but the log lives in Vercel, keyed by
//invocation, and expires. The question actually asked afterwards is never "what happened in invocation
//dpl_xyz" - it is "why does THIS record look like this". That is a question about a record, so the answer
//belongs on the record: what Attio held before the run, every line the run printed, and what it held after.
//
//The Person, the Company, and the Deal each get their own note. The transcript in all three is identical - it
//is one run - and only the two states differ, each record reporting itself.
//
//SELF-CONTAINED BY DESIGN. This module is additive. It imports from the codebase; nothing in the codebase
//imports from it except the marked one-line calls in lib/interested.ts. Deleting this file, its test, and
//every block marked `//debug note in attio=` removes the feature completely and changes nothing else.
//
//INTERESTED RUNS ONLY, without any of the shared modules having to know. Capture is scoped to an open run -
//see withRunLog - and lib/attio.ts is equally the touchpoint crons' code. Those crons never open a scope, so
//their prints pass straight through and are never collected. Nothing needed splitting to achieve that.
//
//[STABILITY] NOTHING HERE MAY THROW INTO A RUN. This is diagnostics attached to an event Attio has already
//committed; losing the transcript is a nuisance, losing the event is a data problem. Every entry point either
//no-ops outside a scope or swallows its own failure onto console.

//One record the run touched, and what it did to it.
//
//THE AFTER STATE IS DERIVED, NOT RE-READ. `baseline` is the record as the run first saw it and `applied` is
//what the run then wrote to it, so the two compose into the state the run left behind - which is what a
//read-back would have cost three further Attio requests to ask. It is exact for everything this codebase
//does: patchRecord has three call sites, all inside writeSalvagingRejections, which only updateAttioAttributes
//calls - so an attribute here can only change through a create whose response is `baseline`, or through a
//write reported to runLogApplied. What it cannot see is Attio's own hand: a value normalised on write, a
//derived attribute, an automation reacting to the write, or a human editing the record mid-run. The note says
//"as this run left it" rather than claiming to be a reading of Attio, because that is what it is.

//WHY MIRROR RATHER THAN CALL A RECORDER AT EACH SITE. The interested path prints from about sixty places
//across six modules. A recorder beside each one duplicates the message string sixty times, and two copies of a
//sentence drift the moment one is edited - a transcript that disagrees with the log is worse than no
//transcript. This way the existing prints are the single source, and neither can be edited without the other.
//
//Vercel's own output is untouched: the original is called first, with the same arguments, every time.
//
//[STABILITY] Installed on a refcount rather than per scope, because runs can overlap - the Aircall sync
//processes interested calls one after another inside a single invocation, and Vercel may run concurrent
//invocations in one instance. The refcount means the last scope to close is what restores the console, and
//AsyncLocalStorage is what keeps overlapping runs' lines apart. The exact original reference is restored, so a
