//WHY IT LIVES HERE. Attio, Instantly, HeyReach and Aircall all answer 429 and all have to decide how long to
//wait. Four copies of the same header parsing would drift - the codebase has been bitten by exactly that
//before, when isTransientAttioError was written for all four syncs and wired into one. One implementation,
//four callers, so a fix to the parsing reaches all of them.
//
//NEITHER HEYREACH NOR AIRCALL SENDS ANY RATE-LIMIT HEADER ON A SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE - both were probed live and
//answered 200 with nothing matching rate/limit/remaining/reset/retry. So there is no allowance to read ahead
//of time and no way to pace proactively; a transport can only react to the refusal when it arrives. That is
//why these two get a retry rather than a self-imposed cap like INSTANTLY_SYNC_PAGE_LIMIT, which exists only
//because Instantly's 20-per-minute ceiling is documented as a hard number.
