//=============================================================================================================
//A wall-clock budget for a sync's per-event loop, so the loop stops of its own accord rather than being killed.
//
//WHY THIS EXISTS. Every sync here saves its cursor once, after its loop. Vercel kills a function at the
//maxDuration in vercel.json (300s), and that kill lands BEFORE the save, so an overrunning run records no
//progress at all: the next run re-reads the same backlog, re-increments every counter it already incremented,
//and overruns again. That is a permanent loop, and a 504 on a sync route means exactly that. It was observed on
//the Aircall sync, whose volume reached the limit first; the other syncs share the shape and so share the risk.
//
//A budget converts the overrun into a clean partial run: the cursor is saved where the loop stopped and the
//remainder is picked up next run. Throughput then becomes a question of how fast a backlog drains rather than
//of whether anything is written at all.
//
//[STABILITY] THE CADENCE MUST EXCEED THE BUDGET. A run may legitimately take the whole budget, and nothing
//guards against two invocations of one sync running at once - they would read the same cursor and double-count
//every event between them. The 300s default and the 240s budget suit the cadences in vercel.json; shortening a
//cadence towards the budget requires lowering that sync's budget with it.
//=============================================================================================================

//[PERF] The margin below maxDuration has to cover the slowest single event still in flight when the budget
//expires (for a touchpoint, up to eight sequential Attio requests) plus the cursor save and the response.
//Raise maxDuration before raising this.
